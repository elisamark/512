# 512
Have you ever played 2048? It's pretty simple, right? Let's make it more complicated...

## The Name
This version of 2048 doesn't go all the way to 2048. Instead, the game is won by creating the 512 tile. You control the game in a similar way to 2048. The arrow keys shift blocks in their respective directions, where they combine with identical tiles. Only multiples of 2 exist. Every turn, a 2 or a 4 will spawn in a random location. 

## The Bombs
Look out for the bombs! Once in a while, a bomb will spawn in a random location. When it combines with another block, it explodes! It takes itself and the other block with it in the blast. This can help your quest for 512, or it bring it crashing down. Be careful.

## Technical Details
This game was written entirely in Java as part of my Grade 12 Computer Science course, ICS4U. The graphics on screen are a combination of .png images and drawing commands from the `Graphics` library. 

## Running It
You can run the game by running the `Main` class.
